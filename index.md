<b>I am a sixth-year Economics PhD student at New York University.</b>

I am interested in macroeconomics with a focus on international and behavioral macroeconomics.

In my job market paper, I study exchange rate expectations of firms and their implications for the transmission of aggregate shocks in a small open economy.

I am on 2024-2025 academic job market.
