# I am an Assistant Professor at New Economic School.

My primary field is international macroeconomics and my secondary fields are macroeconomics, behavioral macroeconomics, and international trade.

In my [recent paper](jmp.pdf), I study exchange rate expectations of firms and their implications for the transmission of aggregate shocks in a small open economy.
