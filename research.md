### Exchange Rate Expectations of Firms: General Equilibrium Implications (Job Market Paper)

The paper explores the role of expectations in the economy's response to exchange rate fluctuations. Using the novel survey by the Central Reserve Bank of Peru, I study firm-level exchange rate forecasts. I document that the firms deviate from the rational benchmark by overreacting to the new information and overestimating the persistence of the current exchange rate. Moreover, I show the connection between exchange rate forecasts and recent and expected actions: a firm expecting a depreciation is more likely to reduce employment and production. I use these facts to develop a behavioral general equilibrium model of a small open economy. The exchange rate is driven by a financial shock distorting the UIP condition, and the firms overestimate its persistence. They set their prices infrequently and associate expected depreciation with a higher future path of marginal cost. Then, overreactive beliefs generate a more contractionary response to depreciation among price-setting firms. I intend to explore the relevance of expectations for aggregate dynamics and misallocation among firms.

### Financial Crisis and Permanent Output Drop: a Model of Reverse Causality (Third year paper)

Why are financial crises followed by slow recoveries? This paper introduces a channel that generates credit tightening in response to an exogenous trend shock to output, reverting the direction of causality prevalent in the literature. When a negative trend shock hits the economy, endogenous borrowing constraint tightens much more than after a transitory shock. In a heterogeneous household model with a no-default borrowing limit, a trend shock causes a sizable fall in credit supply and household debt deleveraging. In contrast, after a temporary shock, household debt increases. The model offers an alternative approach to generating the connection between financial tightening and persistent output losses. In addition, the paper addresses the policy implications of the endogenous borrowing limit. Lowering the penalty for default benefits the defaulting households at the cost of the tightening endogenous constraint. The non-defaulting households must reduce borrowing, so in the quantitative model, the aggregate consumption falls.
